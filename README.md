# MongoDB Coding Challenge

## Task
Writing a program that takes a JSON object as input and outputs a flattened version of the JSON object, with keys as the path to every terminal value in the JSON structure. Output should be valid JSON.

## Requirements
In order to run the project, make sure you have **Node.js** installed

## How to install
1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the project directory

## How to run
The program is expecting a json or text file. Replace '**\<your file path>**' with the path to the file to flatten.

```
cat <your file path> | node challenge.js
```
The flattened JSON will be available in the created '**output.json**' file in the project directory

## Running the script with the tests
To run the script containing some test files, run the following command in the project directory:
```
sh script.sh
```
